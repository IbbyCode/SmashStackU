  This repository contains all of the files that you would find on an SD card that has been used to take snapshots in Super Smash Bros. for Wii U. The end goal is to have a repository containing files that people can use to build an exploit that will launch user-specified code after a small amount of input.
  
  The next step in the creation of this exploit is to find a way to edit the AXxx_album.dat file. This file points to all the game-generated snapshots. If you modify it at all the game will tell you the album data is corrupted and automatically regenerate it upon start. If we find a way to modify the .dat file we could point it to our own code, presumably boot.elf, which is the second step. The final step is for us to create a file named boot.bin, because for each game generated snapshot, there is a .bin file of the same name. These files are encrypted and validate their respectfull images. If a snapshot file or it's correspnding .bin file are edited by anything other than the in-game editor, you don't receive the corrupted data message but the image displays a "no" sign. We need boot.bin to validate boot.elf so that we can run code from Smash 4. This means that we need to crack the encryption of the .bin files or take the SD out while the .bin files are decrypted so that we can create and encrypt boot.bin and have it validate boot.elf.
